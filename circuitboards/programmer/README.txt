Arduino-nano based programmer. 

Connects to instreg-board.
Used to put program into memory.
Can also be used to drive clock-input and run program at desired frequency (or single stepped)

With some careful handling, it can be removed when the program is entered, and be replaced by the 555-based clock (if it feels like cheating to have an arduino connected :-) ).
