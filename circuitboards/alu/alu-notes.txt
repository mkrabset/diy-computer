Floors: (from below)
 1) Ground floor with zero-detection, bus-control, flag-storage (74ls74 flipflops), and external connectors
 
   Design: groundfloor_sync_cc_cs.fzz


 2) RolRor, shift left (rol), or right (ror), shift in carry-in, shift out respectively msb or lsb.
    Sets 8 bit result, and carry out, Disconnected from nonzero output flag.
    Disconnected from both 8-bit output and carry out when either of the operations are active.

    Design: rolror.fzz, Inner pins connects down, Outer pins connects up.


 3) Logical AND, ANDs two 8-bit numbers together. (use 7408 IC)
    Sets 8-bit result. Does not use carry in. Disconnected from nonzero and carryout output flags.
    Disconnected from 8-bit output when not active.
    Requires jumper wire to select AND-operation.
 
    Design: andorxor2.fzz, Inner pins connects up, Outer pins connects down.


 4) Logical OR, ORs two 8-bit numbers together.  (use 7432 IC)
    Sets 8-bit result. Does not use carry in. Disconnected from nonzero and carryout output flags.
    Disconnected from 8-bit output when not active.
    Requires jumper wire to select OR-operation.
 
    Design: andorxor.fzz, Inner pins connects down, Outer pins connects up.


 5) Logical XOR, XORs two 8-bit numbers together.  (use 7486 IC)
    Sets 8-bit result. Does not use carry in. Disconnected from nonzero and carryout output flags.
    Disconnected from 8-bit output when not active.
    Requires jumper wire to select XOR-operation.
 
    Design: andorxor2.fzz, Inner pins connects up, Outer pins connects down.


 6) Logical NOT, inverts an 8-bit number (operand 2).
    Sets 8-bit result, Does not use operand1 or carryIn. 
    Disconnected from nonzero and carryout output bits.
    Disconnected from 8-bit output when not active.

    Design: not.fzz, Inner pins connects down, Outer pins connects up.

 7) Adder, adds two 8 bit numbers.
    For subtraction, invert operand 2, and set carry in.
    Sets 8 bit result, and carry out. Disconnected from nonzero output flag.
    Disconnected from both 8-bit output and carry-out when not active.

    Design: adder.fzz , Inner pins connects up. Outer pins connects down.

 8) AluCtrl. Operation MUX and status display.
    Selects operation by pulling one of the operation activation pins low, while keeping all others high,
    based on the operation selected by the op-select input pins (op2,op1,op0).

    Led displays for: operand1, operand2, carryIn, result, carryOut, nonZero

    Design: aluctrl.fzz, Inner pins connects down, Outer pins connects up.
