Some throughts for the next model:

* Led connectors instead of on-pcb leds
* Current-limiting resistors (330ohm) on all ic outputs.
* Use of 74LS181 for ALU (in addition to ROR/ROL circuitry)
* Support pushing/popping status register to stack
* 64 ram
* 16 bit address bus + 8 bit data bus
* Ground planes
* 4k EEPROMS (12 address lines (4 step bits, 8 instruction bits))
* Ground-connectors on mounting holes on all pcbs
* 4 inputs, 4 outputs
* small 7seg displays for display outputs
* display hex for instruction/step
* halt instruction
* Easy change between programmer and internal clock
* Ground connector between programmer and rest of board
* Decoder on one floor
* More power connectors on each part
* Always m3 caps on all ic power
